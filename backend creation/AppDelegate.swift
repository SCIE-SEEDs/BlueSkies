/*a delegate is a class that does something on behalf of another class, and the AppDelegate is a place to handle special UIApplication states. It has a bunch of functions called by iOS. For instance, if your App is in use and the phone rings, then the function applicationWillResignActive will be called. This is where you should pause tasks, disable timers, etc.
