# Blue Skies

### About
In 2016, the WHO estimated that 92% of the world lives in places where air pollution exceeds safe limits.
The world bank and the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation estimated that deaths caused by air pollution cost the global economy $225 billion dollars. In 2013. Air pollution has only gotten worse in the 7 years since then. 

Blue Skies is an iOS application created by team SCIE during our Dandilyonn internship in Summer 2020. Our goal is to provide accessible, unbiased representation of air pollution - the air quality index for cities - and provide nudges to encourage users to take small actions in their daily lives to reduce air pollution and bring back blue skies.
